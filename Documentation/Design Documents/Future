Future Ideas:
    1. What about some knowledge of how well the individuals of a species performed in the previous generation? What
    if changing connection wts a certain way dramatically improved the performance? Why lose that information and
    randomly perturb again? I suppose if you have enough individuals you're going to get movement in the same way
    again, but this seems unlikely as the ANN size grows large. You'll need too many individuals.

    If you had some idea of the connection wt. delta the generation before and how that impacted fitness you might be
    able to leverage that information to close in on connection wt. optimization faster.

    Make sure to avoid thrashing!

    Massively duplicate a few candidate genomes from promising species and only fiddle with the connection weights
    as described above? Depends on how long any evaluation takes...

    2. Why not keep a global list of all innovations instead of just for the current generation? Connecting hidden node
    a to output node b is the same structural innovation if it occurs in generation 4 vs. generation 20. How do you
    even crossover genomes that have different historical markers that specify the same connection?

    3. Tetris as a good start?! Might be interesting...

    4. We're limited to having the number of hidden nodes at any layer be at most as many inputs or outputs, whichever
     is greater. Since adding node genes splits an existing connection, there is no opportunity to 'widen' the hidden
     node ranks. Is this a limitation or not?
