1. Visualization
    -Species tracking:
        -Species creation and extinction events will be shown
        -The size of each species will be reported every generation
        -The total fitness (sum of the adjusted fitnesses for each species member) of the species each generation will be tracked
        -The max fitness of the best individual in that species for that generation will be recorded
        -The topology of the best individual for that species for each generation will be visible

    -Topology visualization:
        -Topology should be derivable from an individual's genome
        -Zones for nodes should be defined as Inputs on the left or bottom, outputs on the right or top, and hidden in between
        -Innovation numbers will be visible for nodes and connections
        -Weights will be visible on connections

    -General Statistics:
        -Total number of individuals spawned will be tracked
        -Current innovation number by generation will be tracked
        -Total number of node evaluations will be recorded by generation
        -A list of all fitnesses for that generation will be saved for optional statistical analysis
        -The number of hidden nodes will be recorded per generation
        -The number of total connections will be recorded per generation
        -The number of disabled connections will be recorded per generation

    -Real-time visualization a-la MarIO for a given ANN?!
        -Future requirement

2. App Function
    -App will utilize a settings or parameters file where all relevant settings of the NEAT algo will be found
    -No parameters that alter NEAT's behavior will be defined within the code. Defined Params:
        Algo Details:
            -Population size
            -Speciation distance coefficients
            -Speciation threshold
            -Species extinction generation
            -Connection wt mutation rate
            -Connection wt mutation details (% chance perturbed vs % chance random reset)
            -New node mutation rate
            -New connection mutation rate
            -Gene mating disable rate
            -% genomes from mutation only (non-mating)
            -Interspecies mating rate
            -Transfer function
            -Bias node flag
        Other Params:
            -ANN saving settings (Champion each generation, Champion per species per generation, every X generations, etc)
            -A collect stats flag (Dial in the stats? Or just blanket switch?)

3. ANN structure and output evaluation
    -Single node recursive connection acceptable:
        -Must be a hidden node
        -Max one recursive connection per node
        -Output from previous evaluation will be used as input for current evaluation (first evaluation will be 0)
    -There shall be no loops in the network architecture (ie can't spawn new connections to nodes in earlier hidden layers)
    -Node genes:
        -On creation, for every type of gene, a historical innovation number is incremented and assigned.
        -Input Nodes
            -Normal input nodes:
                -Start connected to every output node
                -May evolve connections to hidden nodes
                -May not evolve connections to other input nodes
                -Connection wts to other nodes are initially random
                -Input levels are normalized from -1.0 to 1.0
            -Bias nodes (when present):
                -Act as input nodes with input always set to 1
                -Are otherwise identical to input nodes
        -Hidden Nodes:
            -Initially 0 exist
            -Created from a connection gene, disabling and splitting that gene
    -Connection genes:
